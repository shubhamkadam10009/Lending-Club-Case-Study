# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club is a financial institution that offers loans to customers at varying interest rates. Recognizing that some borrowers may default on their loans, this case study aims to analyze scenarios in which defaults occur. By identifying common patterns and factors associated with these defaults, we can provide targeted recommendations to Lending Club. These suggestions will focus on parameters that should be considered during the loan approval process, enhancing the company's ability to manage risks effectively and ensure smoother business operations.
